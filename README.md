# Plotting the 1974 Motor Trend dataset using the Shiny framework

## Overview

Shiny is a web application framework for R for interactive web applications
without using HTML, CSS or other web frameworks. This project is a simple Shiny
I did for testing the framework. The app, is an interactive scatterplot of the 1974 
Motor Trend dataset (mtcars), in which the user is able to change the variables to plot.

The app can be found here: [Scatterplot Shiny App](https://juande.shinyapps.io/ScatterplotShinyApp)

## Project

This repository contains two files, server.R and ui.R. The first one, server.R, holds the logic
of the app and ui.R is where the UI is defined.
